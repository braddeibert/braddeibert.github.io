Welcome to the source code repository for my personal website, currently hosted on GH Pages. It will be updated sporatically, often when I catch a wave of creative inspiration.

### Content

About me, skillset section, link to my resume, and basic landing page.

### Purpose

Fun.

Erm, I mean - to get a professional presence out on the web.
