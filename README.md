# braddeibert.github.io

Welcome to the source code repository for my personal website, currently hosted on GH Pages. It will be updated sporatically, often when I catch a wave of creative inspiration.

## Concept

The design and user experience of the app is inspired by the ZSH shell, and the various code editor themes I've enjoyed using throughout my career.

## Content

An about page, resume page, and basic landing page.

## Purpose

Fun.

Erm, I mean - to get a professional presence of myself out on the web.
